    <p>A <b>blockchain</b> is a distributed ledger with growing lists of <mark> (blocks)</mark> that are securely linked together via <b>cryptographic</b> hashes.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about A<sup>[1][2]</sup> the previous block. <br>They effectively form a chain <mark>(compare linked list data structure),</mark> with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[14] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.[15]

        The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.[16]
        
        According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters' phase.[17] Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.</p>

    <p>Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus <b> protocol</b> to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, <br>since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design</p>
    <p>The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as <b>Satoshi Nakamoto</b> in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a <b>Hashcashm</b>-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the <b>cryptocurrency bitcoin</b>, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.<sub>[3]</sub></p>
